Once upon a time in a small village there was a king, who used to live with his wife and son.
The Prince was very fond of wild animals and he always wanted to pet a lion. One day the queen insisted the king to go to the Jungle and find a lion for her child as he was very sad for not
getting what he wished for. The king went to the Jungle with his troops to capture a lion.
